# config/

The single home for every constant and tunable in the project (monorepo
Rule #4). No other module may contain a numeric literal that is not a loop
index or an enum value. Read-only at runtime — user-changeable state lives in
the settings file owned by [Settings Store](../app/settings_store.md).

## Files

### `constants.py` — Product Invariants
Values that define what DOMY Watch is and never change: app identity, the
24h dial convention (noon at top, clockwise), time constants, the
weekday → celestial body mapping.

### `defaults.py` — Developer Tunables
Window sizing, the spontaneous-hide watchdog delay, settings schema version
and write debounce, the M1 placeholder dial palette and layout fractions,
tray icon geometry. From M3 this file also hosts `DEFAULT_SKIN` (a typed
SkinDefinition instance).

### `winapi.py` — Win32 Literals
The only sanctioned home for Win32 API constants (documented enum-exception
to Rule #4). Consumed by `app/native.py` from M4.

### `paths.py` — Frozen-Safe Paths
Resolves `Database/`, `assets/skins/` and `%APPDATA%/DOMY Watch/` from
`Path(__file__)` / `sys._MEIPASS` — never from the working directory, so a
PyInstaller `--onedir` bundle finds its data.

## Connections

### Used by
- [App (folder)](../app/___app.md) — window/tray/settings read all four files
- Core, data, skins, render (M2+) — invariants and paths

## Design Decisions
- Python modules, not JSON: constants need typing, expressions (e.g. `sqrt`)
  and direct imports.
- Three tiers by ownership: developer config here, declarative skin config in
  `skin.json` per skin (M5), user runtime state in `settings.json`.
