"""Guard test - THE SPACE & LEGIBILITY LAW, static half (rules/GUI.md).

Installed from rules/templates/test_layout_law.py (MIGRATE-LAYOUT.md step 1,
owner order 2026-08-06 - the Watch Face rework shipped a window whose
sections overflow a 4K screen, so this project gets the teeth now).

What it fails on: GUI sources that cut content off, or that freeze an element
so it cannot take the window's free space - elide/trim APIs, forced
scrollbars, disabled wrapping, hard pixel sizes on text-bearing widgets.

A single line may opt out ONLY with a stated reason, written in that line's
comment as:  layout-law: exempt - <why>
An exemption with no reason does not count.

The runtime half of the law lives in `tests/test_layout_audit.py` - this test
catches the CAUSES by name, that one catches the RESULT on screen.
