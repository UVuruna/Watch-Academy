# data/

Four repositories over `Database/*.json` — the only code that knows the
file schemas. Loud failures with the supported range in the message
(Rule #1); plain dataclasses out; no Qt (enforced by the purity test).

## Files

### `locations.py` — Location Repository
LAZY over the 4 MB `world_locations.json` (45,650 cities; loaded on
demand, released when the picker closes). Handles the MIXED depth — 127
of 241 countries mix direct-city leaves with admin sub-dicts — by
classifying every child by shape (`"latitude" in value`), never by depth.
Yields `CityRecord`, the only thing persisted after selection.
See [Locations](locations.md).

### `seasons.py` — Seasons Repository
Extract-and-discard over `seasons_utc.json` (1560–2640): parses once per
year, keeps a tiny `YearAnchors`, drops the dict. Handles the verified
field trap: a year's `winter.start` is the December solstice OF that year
(ending the entry), while `winter.duration` describes the winter that
BEGAN it — the two are never paired. See [Seasons](seasons.md).

### `moon_phases.py` — Moon Phases Repository
Windowed extraction over `moonPhases_utc.json` (1551–2649): the target
year plus both neighbors, month keys filtered with `isdigit()` (year
entries mix month dicts with aggregate count keys), "Last Quarter"
normalized to "Third Quarter". See [Moon Phases](moon_phases.md).

### `symbolism.py` — Symbolism Repository
Per-body blurbs and the full ARTICLE corpus from `symbolism.json` (the
machine-readable companion of [DOMY Symbolism](../SYMBOLISM.md)) — the
hover articles per theme, sign, animal, element and Trinity virtue.
See [Symbolism Repository](symbolism.md).

### `translations.py` — Translations
Translate-once-then-cache (owner spec: we ship only English): corpus
collection, the keyless gtx client, the hash-tracked per-language
cache and the Serbian Cyrillic→Latin transliteration.
See [Translations](translations.md).

### `rings.py` — Ring Presets
The ring preset cards (bundled `ring_presets.json` + the user's custom
cards from settings): `{name, positions, letters}`, layouts resolved by
the positions signature, loud validation. See [Ring Presets](rings.md).

### `_io.py` — Shared Loader
`load_json_checked()` — a plain function, not a base class (a few small
repositories do not justify a hierarchy).
